## Version 5
Ability to add cows as obstacles, and 'wild' flowers to make the game more interesting.

## Version 4
Made "can't lose" skill level where computer makes the worst move.

## Version 3
A Monte Carlo simulation and a scoring function was used to allow the computer player to make better moves. I chose Monte Carlo over a minimax algorithm because it should be easy to set "skill" levels by changing the number of trials.

## Version 2
Make version that has the option of 1 or 2 two players.

## Version 1
A basic playable Tic Tac Toe game with options to expand the board to a 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 grid.
In this version, you play against the computer.
To make it fun for the kids, I let the computer choose it's square by random, which, I find for a 3 x 3 board, actually provides enough challenge for children - they can win!
